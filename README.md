# movie-client
This website is like an IMDB, but littler. View movies and their details, create a user and keep track of your favorites, look up by director or genre, and search through titles.

Running on React 18, react-bootstrap, react-redux, parcel and a couple others.

This project is built with Parcel v2.
`npm i --location=global parcel@next`

And to run:
Copy `example.env` to `.env` and update the parameters, then `npm i` and `npm start` or `parcel ./src/index.html`

This frontend was built to interact with the server built [here](https://github.com/bentleyjensen/movie-api).
